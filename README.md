# Petree's Prints
The goal of this project was to create a client's web application for her business focusing in large format photography printing. Our team was paired with this client through the University of Florida's Software Engineering class. 
<br><br>
The customer creates an account and can purchase prints on the order page. They would upload an image, and then select a size and a medium. The client has access to an admin dashboard to update/manage these placed orders. 

## Development Process

This application was coded in JavaScript and utilized the MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js. 
<br><br>
The original team repository is located at: https://github.com/lincarl1/photoproject
<br>
Our application is live at: https://petreeprints.herokuapp.com/
<br><br>
This repository holds my personal updates and improvements after completing UF's Software Engineering class.
